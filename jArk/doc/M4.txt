Issues: .jar not working O_o

TODO:	we have to finish implementing some bonus
		add some listener
		add player support
		add ending event
		finish the gui
		add a level editor
		add an algorithm to create levels
		...

Solved Issues:
- The view has to know the Model, and not the inverse. 
  We had to refactor the project. At this moment Model and View are completely divided.
- The different images of each element (bonus, vaus, ball and brick) were inside the element, 
  and each time they were needed they were created (new). Now the images are all in a class in View and
  there is only one instance of each image for all the elements 
  (they are created wih the constructor of that class and only the reference is passed on).
- We had to add Listeners in order to apply the changes given by bonuses (ie. to the vaus)

Implemented:
Bonuses: everything except for shooting vauses and sticky ball (lives are half implemented)

Brick types: 
we have 4 different bricks: 
default, destroyed the fist time it is hit;
persistent, which doesn't get destroyed;
resistent, needs to be hit 2 times
very resistent, three times.

Images: each bonus/vaus/ball/brick has its image. 
		Those images are created inside an hashmap in view.ImagesReference, 
		and only a reference is given to the GamePanel which draws them.
		
Swing Timer instead of Threads

Furthermore, we added more tests, fixed a lot of bugs, and refactored the entire project.
