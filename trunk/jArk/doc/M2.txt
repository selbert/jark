- Added inheritance (bonus, brick, vaus)
- Changed packet structure (issue 2 and 3)
- Removed state from vaus (issue 1)

- issue: bouncing method.
	- solved with current and next position of the ball on the matrix.

- issue: bonus returning w/o passing from ball (to lower the coupling)
	- bonus treated by game, ball returns the brick to explode and the game class lets the level class handle it and return a bonus.

TODO: redo bonus/bonuse, vaus and brick with inheritance (implement)
