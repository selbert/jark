- Added inheritance (bonus, brick, vaus)
- Changed packet structure (issue 2 and 3)
- Removed state from vaus (issue 1)
- Solved issue 1 (google code).

- issue: bouncing method.
	- solved with current and next position of the ball on the matrix.

- issue: bonus returning w/o passing from ball (to lower the coupling)
	- bonus treated by game, ball returns the brick to explode and the game class lets the level class handle it and return a bonus.

- project has to be run from bash in order to view the simulation (only the field is shown, the ball is invisible at the moment)
to run it: just press enter continuously, or type something to quit. You will see the bricks hit by the ball disappearing. 

*****
Pay attention: also if we have few tests, we are quit sure the implemented things are working properly.
Moreover this is an early stage of our project, we have to improve a lot of things and change a lot more.
The most important element at this time, is the ball. And this is tested.
